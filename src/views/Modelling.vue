          | In an era where personal branding intersects with digital innovation, I’ve carved a unique path merging software development, graphic design, and modelling into a unified expression of identity. My modelling career, rooted in Kenya’s vibrant creative landscape, transcends aesthetics. It’s a platform for youth empowerment, cultural representation, and multidimensional storytelling.

        p.mb-3(data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100")
          | My entry into modelling was intentional. I saw it not as a detour from tech and design, but as a strategic extension of my personal brand. The first time I appeared on stage, it did not feel like a new thing. I felt like I was supposed to do it earlier. Hearing the crowd branding me the name “Babu kwa sababu” gave me the confidence that the stage would be a home for a long time. I did not just want to be seen; I wanted every image to speak to who I am — technically skilled, creatively driven, and spiritually grounded.

          | Each photoshoot, runway walk, and campaign became an opportunity to challenge stereotypes and showcase the diversity of African beauty and talent. Collaborating with photographers, designers, and brands, I curated a portfolio that reflects not just fashion trends, but narratives of resilience, ambition, and cultural pride.

        p.mb-3(data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100")
          | Unlike traditional models who rely solely on physical presence, I bring a designer’s eye to every shoot. I conceptualize mood boards, select palettes that align with my brand identity, and collaborate on compositions that reflect both style and substance. My understanding of layout, typography, and colour theory — honed through years of graphic design — translates seamlessly into visual storytelling. This approach echoes the principles of design thinking: empathy, ideation, and iteration. Each pose is purposeful. Each frame is a prototype of the message I aim to convey — confidence, resilience, and authenticity.

          | Beyond the camera, I’ve used my platform to advocate for causes close to my heart: youth unemployment, education, fitness, and mental wellness. I speak openly about the importance of stoicism, healthy dietary habits, and men’s mental health, especially in African communities where such conversations are often overlooked. By sharing my journey and the challenges I’ve faced, I aim to inspire young people to pursue their passions fearlessly and unapologetically.

        p.mb-4(data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100")
          | My modelling work includes editorial shoots, youth-focused campaigns, and personal branding sessions that integrate my technical and creative identities. It’s been featured in local showcases and online platforms that celebrate African innovation and style. I continue to build a digital presence that encourages young creatives to embrace their full selves — whether in code, canvas, or camera.
