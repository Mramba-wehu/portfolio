  h1 ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
  h2 "Empowering Institutions Through Precision, Purpose, and Faith"
  p This is a web-based attendance management system designed to streamline and enhance the process of tracking and managing attendance for educational institutions, businesses, or organizations. The system offers a user-friendly interface for administrators, teachers, and students to efficiently record, monitor, and analyze attendance data.

  p In today’s fast-paced academic and organizational environments, accurate attendance tracking is more than a logistical necessity it’s a cornerstone of accountability, performance, and trust. My Attendance Management System was born out of a desire to streamline this process, reduce manual errors, and offer institutions a reliable, scalable solution built with modern web technologies and a heart for service.

  p At its core, the system is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users of all technical backgrounds can navigate and utilize its features with ease. The platform is built using a robust technology stack, including Vue.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. This combination ensures a responsive, efficient, and scalable application capable of handling the demands of various institutions.

  h3 My Role & Journey
  p Designed and developed this system from scratch, applying principles of modular architecture, clean UI/UX, and open-source etiquette. The process wasn’t without its challenges—debugging authentication flows, refining responsive layouts, and ensuring data integrity across sessions. But through prayer, persistence, and late-night coding marathons, the vision came to life.
